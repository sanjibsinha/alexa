# Creating and Printing Variables:

name = "Bob"
age = 30
print(name)
print(age)


# Working with Numbers:


num1 = 10
num2 = 5
sum_result = num1 + num2
print("Sum:", sum_result)

# Playing with Strings:

greeting = "Hello"
name = "Alice"
message = greeting + ", " + name + "!"
print(message)


# Exploring Lists:

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits[0])  # Accessing the first element
fruits.append("orange")  # Adding an item
print(fruits)

# Tinkering with Dictionaries:

person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print("Name:", person["name"])
print("Age:", person["age"])
